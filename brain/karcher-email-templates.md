## Template 3: No Response Reminder (7-10 Days)

**Subject:** Quick Reminder - Let's Move Forward [Company Name]

Sometimes these slip through the inbox - no problem!

**Can you help me understand:**
- Is this still a priority for you?
- Is there anything holding up the decision?

If the timing isn't right, I completely understand. Just let me know so I can follow up at a better time.

## Template 4: "Still Interested?" (14 Days No Response)

**Subject:** [Company Name] - Status Update?

Hi [Contact Name],

I haven't heard back on the proposal from [DATE], so I wanted to check in.

A few possibilities:
1. **You're still reviewing** → Let's discuss by phone (takes 15 min)
2. **Timing changed** → When does this make sense? I'll follow up then.
3. **You went with someone else** → No worries! I'd appreciate feedback.
4. **Questions about the proposal** → Happy to clarify anything

Either way, let me know where you're at. I'd rather know than assume!

Best,

**Subject:** [Company Name] - Sorry We Couldn't Work Together

Hi [Contact Name],

I understood you went with [Competitor] for the cleaning solution. I totally respect that decision!

Before we close this out, I'd genuinely appreciate any feedback:

3. Specific features they had that we didn't?
4. Service/support offering?

Your feedback helps me serve the next facility better. And who knows - maybe our paths cross again when your needs change.

Thanks for considering Kärcher. I meant it about wanting to work together.
