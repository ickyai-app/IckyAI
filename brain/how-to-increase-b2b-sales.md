# How to Increase Your Sales in B2B

*A living guide that grows with your experience. Update this as you learn what works.*

## 1. Pipeline Foundation

### Build a Real Pipeline
- **Don't guess.** Track every prospect from first contact to closed deal
- Know exactly where each deal is: prospect → qualified → demo → quote → close
- Update it DAILY (not weekly, not monthly)
- Review it every Friday: what's moving? what's stuck?

### The Math You Need
```
Your goal: €X per month
Average deal size: €Y
Deals needed: X ÷ Y
Your close rate: Z%
Prospects needed: (X ÷ Y) ÷ Z%
Activities per deal: W
Activities needed today: Calculate backwards from goal
```

**Example:**
- Goal: €50,000/month
- Avg deal: €10,000 (so need 5 deals)
- Close rate: 20% (typical B2B)
- Need: 25 prospects in pipeline
- Activities per prospect: 3-5 touches
- Activities needed: 75-125 per month (3-6 per day)

## 2. Get in the Room (Prospecting)

### Three Ways to Get Meetings
1. **Referrals** (easiest, warmest)
   - Ask every closed customer: "Who else do you know...?"
   - Offer a small incentive (discount on next service, gift)
   - Follow up within 48 hours

2. **Cold Outreach** (hardest, but scalable)
   - Call the decision maker (not the assistant)
   - Have ONE reason to call: "I help [type] companies do [specific thing]"
   - Expect 80-90% rejections
   - Call again in 2 weeks if no answer

3. **Inbound** (they call you)
   - Website, Google My Business, LinkedIn
   - Answer immediately (within 2 hours if possible)
   - Qualification call within 24 hours

### The Call Script (Keep it short)
```
"Hi [NAME], this is [YOU] from [COMPANY].
I help [INDUSTRY] companies [SPECIFIC BENEFIT].
I noticed you're [SOMETHING RELEVANT].
Do you have 15 minutes this week to explore if we could help?"
```

**Why it works:**
- Specific (not generic)
- Value-focused (what's in it for THEM)
- Time-bounded (15 min, not open-ended)
- Easy "yes" (low commitment)

## 3. Qualify Like a Pro

### Ask These Questions First
Before wasting time on a demo:

1. **Budget:** "What's your budget for this?"
   - If they say "I don't know" → they're not serious yet
   - If they dodge → walk away

2. **Timeline:** "When do you need this solved?"
   - Ideal: "Next 30 days"
   - Red flag: "Sometime this year" (no urgency = no deal)

3. **Decision:** "Who else needs to approve this?"
   - If 5+ people → longer sales cycle
   - Try to get them all in one room

4. **Problem:** "What's your main pain point?"
   - Listen 80% of the time
   - Only talk 20%
   - They tell you how to sell to them

### Disqualify Fast
- Budget: Under what they need? Walk.
- Timeline: 6+ months away? Walk.
- Decision: No budget authority? Walk.
- Problem: Not actually a problem for them? Walk.

**Your time is your most valuable asset.** Spend it on real opportunities.

## 4. The Demo / Presentation

### Before You Demo:
- Know their main pain point (from call)
- Prepare 3 slides MAX
- Practice it once
- Bring a one-pager (3-5 bullet points only)

### During the Demo:
- **Ask questions first** (70% listening)
- "What would solving this be worth to you?"
- Show only features that solve THEIR problem
- Don't show off everything
- End with: "Does this address your needs?"

### After the Demo:
- Send a follow-up within 24 hours
- Recap what they said their problem was
- Show how you solve it
- Include: price, timeline, next steps
- Ask for a YES/NO/MAYBE → not a maybe

## 5. Pricing & Proposals

### Pricing Mistakes
❌ "What's your budget?" (They'll say low)
❌ Giving price before understanding value (They'll shop you)
❌ Long detailed proposals (Nobody reads them)
❌ Following up after 1 week (Too slow)

### Do This Instead
✅ State your price confidently (you know it's fair)
✅ Tie price to their problem: "This costs €X but saves you €Y per year"
✅ Short proposal: 1 page, 3 sections (problem, solution, price)
✅ Follow up after 2 days: "How are you feeling about this?"

### Proposal Template
```
PROPOSAL FOR: [Company Name]

PROBLEM:
[Their specific pain, in their words]

SOLUTION:
[How we solve it, 3 bullet points]

INVESTMENT:
€X per month / €Y total
ROI: [If applicable: costs this, saves that]

TIMELINE:
Start: [Date]
Complete: [Date]
```

## 6. Close the Deal

### Warning Signs They're Not Ready
- "Let me think about it" (means no)
- "We'll need to talk to accounting" (budget not approved)
- "Can you send more info?" (they don't want a call)
- "Call me next month" (they're not interested, you're persistent)

### How to Close
1. **Assumptive close:** "When can we start?"
2. **Alternative close:** "Monday or Wednesday better for you?"
3. **Urgent close:** "We have capacity this week, but next month might be tight"
4. **Direct close:** "Are you ready to move forward?"

### If They Say No
- Don't disappear
- Ask: "What would change your mind?"
- Stay in touch (monthly, not weekly)
- They'll likely buy from whoever stays top-of-mind

---

## 7. After the Sale (Retention & Upsell)

### First 30 Days
- Check in at day 3 (are they happy?)
- Check in at day 15 (answer questions)
- Get a testimonial at day 30

### Every Quarter
- Review their results: "Is this solving what we said?"
- Suggest small improvements
- Look for upsell opportunities
- Schedule a brief call

### Annual Reviews
- Sit down, review results, discuss next year
- Increase pricing 3-5% (if appropriate)
- Ask for referrals
- Plan for their growth

## 8. Your Weekly Routine

### Monday Morning (30 min)
- Review pipeline
- What deals closed last week?
- What's stalled?
- What needs a push this week?

### Tuesday-Thursday (Daily)
- Prospecting: 3-5 new outreach attempts
- Demos/Calls: 2-3 qualification or demo calls
- Follow-ups: reply to all questions same day
- Proposals: send if demo went well

### Friday (1 hour)
- Update pipeline
- Review week: what worked? what didn't?

## 9. Metrics That Matter

Track these:
- **Calls made:** Target 15-20/week
- **Meetings booked:** Target 3-5/week
- **Demos done:** Target 2-3/week
- **Proposals sent:** Target 1-2/week
- **Deals closed:** Target 1-2/month (depends on your cycle)
- **Close rate:** Should be 20-40% (proposals → closed)
- **Sales cycle length:** How long from first call to close?
