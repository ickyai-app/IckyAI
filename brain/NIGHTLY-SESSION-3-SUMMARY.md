## 💬 Sample Questions You Can Ask

### Daily Priorities
```
You: "What should I do today?"
Coach: "🎯 Top 3 Priorities for Feb 2:
  1. Call Celovite storitve (€150k net new!)
  2. Schedule Sintal EKO robot demo (€40k)
  3. Consolidation call with Modri Val (€30k)
  
  Total 30-day target: €195k"
```

### Competitive Strategy
```
You: "How do I beat TASKI?"
Coach: "⚔️ TASKI Battle Plan...
  At Sintal EKO: Demo side-by-side robot comparison
  At Aktiva: Emphasize standardization (you have KIRA)
  At Modri Val: Price advantage via consolidation
  At EES: Product categories they're missing"
```

### Account Coaching
```
You: "Help me close Sintal EKO"
Coach: "📊 Sintal EKO Strategy...
  Contact: Miha Legin (Operations Director)
  Budget: €200k (HIGHEST)
  Pain point: TASKI robots winning
  Your advantage: Better reliability, support in Slovenia
  This week: Call Miha for demo appointment
  Revenue: €40-80k"
```

### Objection Handling
```
You: "What if they say TASKI is cheaper?"
Coach: "🛡️ Response:
  'You're right, TASKI has aggressive pricing. 
   But let's look at total cost - TASKI breaks down more often, 
   you spend more on repairs and downtime.
   Kärcher costs more upfront but saves €10-20k/year in maintenance.
   Want to see the math?'"
