## 🗣️ Quick Scripts (From AI Coach)

### Celovite storitve (New Contact)
> "Hi [NAME], I'm [YOU] from Kärcher. Congratulations on the new role! I work with several major BSC companies in Slovenia managing their cleaning equipment. Can I show you what we can do for you? 15 minutes this week?"

### Sintal EKO (Robot Battle)
> "Miha, you're smart to think robots. TASKI is good, but Kärcher robots outperform on your facility type. Let me show you a quick demo - 30 minutes, no obligation."

### Aktiva Skupina (Expansion)
> "Katja, I know you're expanding. You picked KIRA because it's the best. Let's keep your fleet standardized on Kärcher instead of mixing in other brands."

### Modri Val (Consolidation)
> "Anže, you're currently using 3 different suppliers. That means 3 invoices, 3 contacts, 3 problems. What if you consolidated everything with Kärcher? I can save you €10k/year plus you get one point of contact."

### EES Sistemi (Product Expansion)
> "Lidija, your backpack vacs are great. Now let me show you the equipment you're missing - scrubber-driers, industrial vacuums, pressure washers. These could save you time and money."

### B+N Facilities (Upsell)
> "Urša, let's do a quarterly check-in. I want to make sure you're getting the best performance from your equipment and find opportunities to optimize your operations."
