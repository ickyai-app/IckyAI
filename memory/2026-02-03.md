# Feb 3, 2026 - IckyAI Deployment Debug Session

## Critical Status
- **Project:** IckyAI (Sales pipeline + AI Coach)
- **Issue:** AI Coach component not appearing in Coaching tab on Vercel
- **Last Working Commit:** 9a6e72a ("Deploy AI Coach to Vercel - Add AI Sales Coach with Slovenian account intelligence")
- **Current Status:** Dev server running locally at http://localhost:3000

## Root Cause Found
**Duplicate folder structure was breaking builds:**
- `/app/` with OLD broken .tsx files
- `/ickyai-net/` with WORKING .jsx files  
- `/ickyai-app/` with more old code
- `/ickyai-clean/` (empty folder)

Vercel was building from root `/app/` (wrong code) instead of `/ickyai-net/` (correct code).

## Solution Applied
1. Reset to commit 9a6e72a (last working version)
2. Force pushed to GitHub
3. Cleaned up all duplicate folders locally
4. Started dev server: `npm run dev`

## Current Test
Icky needs to:
1. Open http://localhost:3000 locally
2. Click "🚀 Use Demo Login"
3. Click "🎯 Coaching" tab
4. Check if AI Coach with text input appears

This will tell us if it's a code issue or Vercel cache issue.

## Key Files
- AICoach.jsx - Has all the UI code (text input, messages, quick buttons)
- Dashboard.jsx - Correctly imports AICoach and renders it when activeTab === 'coaching'
- Components working: LoginPage, PipelineOverview, AccountsForm, ActivitiesForm, FollowUpReminders, EmailTemplates, Sidebar

## Known Issues
- CORS errors from Supabase (expected, app falls back to demo mode)
- Vercel auto-deploy not triggering from GitHub push (webhook issue)
- Manual "Redeploy" on Vercel works fine with old code

## Next Steps if Local Works
1. Force rebuild on Vercel with cache clear
2. If still fails, investigate why new commits won't build
3. Consider deleting and recreating Vercel project if necessary

## FINAL DIAGNOSIS (15:36)
**Root Cause Found:** Missing dependency `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- Error: "Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/postcss'"
- Cause: Broken node_modules or package-lock.json
- Solution: Clean install required

## REQUIRED FIX (PRIORITY)
```bash
cd C:\Users\kleme\.openclaw\workspace
rm -r node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then test locally at http://localhost:3000 → Demo Login → Coaching tab

## If Clean Install Works
1. Code is correct, dependencies were broken
2. Push to GitHub
3. Redeploy on Vercel (should work now)

## If Clean Install Still Fails
Consider fresh Next.js scaffold:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest ickyai-fresh
```
Then port the working components from current project.
