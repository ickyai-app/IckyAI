## Memory System Fix
- Icky pointed out: After computer restart, I lose all context
- Root cause: Not reading memory files at session start
- Solution implemented:
  1. Create daily memory files (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
  2. Update MEMORY.md with current status
  3. Read memory files first thing on restart
  4. Keep restart protocol in MEMORY.md

## Active Systems (Confirmed Running)
- Morning Brief: 8:00 AM daily ✅
- Nightly Coder: 11:00 PM daily ✅

## ✅ COMPLETE SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED (Feb 2 Evening)

**Memory System:**
- ✅ Daily memory files (`memory/2026-02-02.md`, etc.)
- ✅ Long-term memory (MEMORY.md with current status)
- ✅ Restart protocol (read memory first thing)

**Cron Jobs Configured:**
1. ✅ 7:00 AM - Morning Heartbeat Check
2. ✅ 8:00 AM - Morning Brief (weather, trends, tasks)
3. ✅ 7:00 PM - Evening Heartbeat Check
4. ✅ 11:00 PM - Nightly Coder (build tools, automation)

**Result:** Icky gets proactive check-ins 4x daily, never loses context on restart

**Next Step:** Add Telegram/Signal/WhatsApp for instant 24/7 messaging (awaiting channel choice)

## Icky's Feedback
- Wants everything documented so context survives restarts
- Values proactive, automated work
- Site looks great, will need tweaks

*When restarting: Read MEMORY.md first, then this file.*
