# Slovenian BSC Win-Back Strategy - Detailed Action Plan

## Executive Summary

**Total Market Opportunity:** €750,000/year from 6 companies
**Current Kärcher Share:** ~20-30% (estimated €150-225k)
**Opportunity:** Increase to 50-70% = **€375-525k additional revenue**

---

## COMPANY #1: Celovite storitve ⭐⭐ PRIORITY #1

### Situation
- **Current Kärcher:** ❌ NONE
- **Budget:** €150k/year
- **Contact:** New director (name unknown)
- **Competitors:** Unknown (ENTIRE BUDGET AT STAKE)

### This is a BLANK SLATE

**Why this matters:**
You have NO relationship debt here. The old relationships might not transfer to new director. This is either:
- Biggest opportunity (win them from scratch)
- Biggest threat (competitor already owns them)

### Your Action Plan

#### Week 1: Intelligence + Introduction
**URGENCY: THIS WEEK**

```
CALL: New director
SCRIPT:
"Hi [NAME], I'm [YOU] from Kärcher. 
Congratulations on the new role!
I work with several major BSC companies in Slovenia 
managing their cleaning equipment.
I'd like to understand what your cleaning needs are
and show you what Kärcher can do for you.
15 minutes this week?"
```

**If they say yes:**
- Meeting goal: Understand their pain points
- What equipment do they currently use?
- What budget are they working with?
- Who makes equipment decisions?
- What's their biggest cleaning challenge?

**If they hesitate:**
- "Great companies like [Aktiva/EES] use us. Maybe we can help you too."
- "No commitment, just want to introduce ourselves"

#### Week 2: Needs Analysis
**Prepare for meeting:**
- [ ] Learn their facility types (shopping, offices, industrial?)
- [ ] Prepare 3 relevant Kärcher solutions
- [ ] Bring comparison sheet vs typical setup
- [ ] Have ROI calculator ready

#### Week 3: Demo or Proposal
- [ ] Based on meeting, propose demo or direct proposal
- [ ] Focus on BIGGEST pain point
- [ ] Show clear advantage
- [ ] Get commitment for next step

#### Week 4: Close
- [ ] Close first order
- [ ] GOAL: €50-75k first quarter

### The Pitch (Generic, Modify Based on Needs)
> "Most companies like yours use a mix of equipment. Here's what I typically see: [LIST]. With Kärcher, you get professional-grade quality that lasts longer and performs better. Plus, I can give you better support than generic suppliers. Let me show you what I'm talking about - one demo machine, no obligation."

### Success Metric
**Q1 Goal:** €50,000 in new orders

---

## COMPANY #2: Sintal EKO - €200k Budget (Highest) ⭐ PRIORITY #2

### Situation
- **Current Kärcher:** Vacuum cleaners + SGG
- **Competitor Problem:** TASKI robots (they're winning)
- **Budget:** €200k/year (HIGHEST)
- **Contact:** Miha Legin, Operations Director
- **Key Insight:** They KNOW Kärcher (like our vacs), but competitor winning on robots

### Your Opportunity

**They like us, but losing on robotics.**

TASKI has convinced them robots are the future. They're right - robots ARE the future. **But Kärcher has robots too!**

### Your Action Plan

#### This Week: Intelligence Gathering
**CALL Miha:**
```
"Hi Miha, how's the equipment working?
I noticed you've invested in TASKI robots.
How's that going?
Have you looked at Kärcher's robot options?
I want to make sure you're getting best value."
```

**What to listen for:**
- Why did they choose TASKI? (price? features? relationship?)
- How are the robots performing?
- What other equipment do they need?
- When do they replace equipment?
- Is there budget for additional robots this year?

#### Week 2: Competitive Analysis
**Know TASKI vs Kärcher:**

TASKI robot advantages:
- May be cheaper upfront
- Existing relationship

Kärcher robot advantages:
- Better technology (Kärcher is leader globally)
- Better support
- Can integrate with other Kärcher equipment
- Longer lifespan

#### Week 3: Demo Request
```
"Miha, I'd like to show you our robot side-by-side 
with what you're using from TASKI.
No pressure - just let's compare performance.
I'm confident you'll see the difference.
Can we schedule a demo at one of your facilities?"
```

#### Week 4: Demo Execution
- Demo on their facility
- Show Kärcher robot cleaning same area as TASKI
- Measure time/quality differences
- Get feedback
- Propose follow-up

### Financial Case (ROBOT)

| Factor | TASKI | Kärcher |
|---|---|---|
| Purchase price | €35,000 | €42,000 |
| Lifespan | 5 years | 8 years |
| Annual maintenance | €3,000 | €2,000 |
| Efficiency (m²/hr) | 800 | 950 |
| Total 8-year cost | €48,000 | €48,000 |
| **Winner** | **Tie on cost** | **Better performance** |

**Your pitch:** "Same total cost. Better performance. That's Kärcher."

### Success Metric
**Q1 Goal:** €40,000+ (robot + complementary equipment)

---

## COMPANY #3: Aktiva Skupina - Robotics Expansion ⭐ PRIORITY #3

### Situation
- **Current Kärcher:** KIRA CV 50 (robot) + carpet vacuums (GOOD!)
- **Problem:** Buying TASKI for other needs
- **Budget:** €100k/year BASE (but EXPANDING for robotics!)
- **Contact:** Katja Meserič, Operations Manager
- **Key Insight:** THEY ALREADY LIKE KÄRCHER (bought our robot) but exploring other brands

### Your Opportunity

**They bought KIRA from us. Now they're exploring TASKI.**

This is a relationship you already have. Leverage it.

### The Situation
"We like Kärcher, but we're expanding. Want to see other options too."

### Your Action Plan

#### THIS WEEK: Urgency Call
**CALL Katja immediately:**
```
"Hi Katja! I heard exciting news - 
you're expanding into more robotics!
That's great.
Before you commit to new suppliers,
I want to show you what else we have.
You already know KIRA. We have solutions
for [their specific facility types].
15 minutes next week?"
```

**Key message:** "You know us. We deliver. Let's expand together."

#### Week 2: Expansion Meeting
**What to discuss:**
- Which new facilities are they cleaning?
- What equipment types do they need?
- What's their budget for expansion?
- Timeline for purchase?
- Decision process?

**What to propose:**
- "Since you're happy with KIRA, I recommend [SOLUTION A] for [facility type]"
- Show how Kärcher products work together
- Volume pricing (multiple machines)

#### Week 3: Proposal
- Prepare proposal for €50-80k in new equipment
- Show integration with existing KIRA
- Emphasize relationship (we know you, support is easy)

#### Week 4: Close
- Get commitment
- Schedule delivery/implementation

### Financial Case (Expansion)

**Scenario:** They need 2 scrubber-driers + 1 vacuum for new facilities

| Equipment | Kärcher | TASKI |
|---|---|---|
| Scrubber-Drier x2 | €40,000 | €38,000 |
| Vacuum | €8,000 | €7,500 |
| Integration with existing | ✅ Seamless | ❌ Complex |
| Support | ✅ Single vendor | ❌ Multiple vendors |
| **Total 5-year cost** | **€50,000** | **€52,000** |

**Your pitch:** "You already have KIRA working great. Add compatible Kärcher equipment. Same vendor, lower total cost, easier support."

### Success Metric
**Q1 Goal:** €50,000+ in new equipment orders

---

## COMPANY #4: Modri Val - Pressure Washer Base

### Situation
- **Current Kärcher:** High pressure washers ONLY
- **Gap:** Missing all other equipment
- **Competitors:** PanGoslar (cheap Chinese), TASKI
- **Budget:** €100k/year
- **Contact:** Anže Vovčko (OWNER - decision maker!)
- **Key Insight:** You're in, but only in one category. HUGE upsell opportunity

### Your Opportunity

**They trust you on pressure washers. Expand to other categories.**

### Why This Matters
- Only pressure washers = only €30-50k of their €100k budget
- Other €50-70k is going to competitors
- You can win that by showing expanded product line

### Your Action Plan

#### This Week: The Pitch
**CALL Anže (the owner!):**
```
"Hi Anže, how are the pressure washers treating you?
Great! I've noticed you're getting other equipment 
from PanGoslar and TASKI.
I want to show you something - 
Kärcher makes everything your business needs.
What if I could be your one-stop-shop?
Maybe save you money by consolidating suppliers?
15 minutes?"
```

### What Equipment Are They Missing?
**Based on typical BSC, they probably need:**
- Scrubber-driers (for indoor hard floors)
- Vacuum cleaners (for carpets)
- Sweepers (for outdoor areas)
- Compact machines (for tight spaces)

### Your Action Plan

#### Week 1: Gap Analysis
- What other equipment do they currently use?
- Who supplies each?
- What's the issue with current setup? (price? quality? service?)

#### Week 2: Product Demo
- Bring one demo machine (pick biggest gap)
- Compare to what they're using from PanGoslar/TASKI
- Show quality difference
- Discuss volume pricing

#### Week 3: Full Proposal
- "Here's everything you need from Kärcher"
- Show consolidated supplier advantage
- Volume discount structure
- Simplified support

#### Week 4: Close
- First order of new equipment

### Financial Case

**Current situation:** Fragmented suppliers
```
Pressure washers (Kärcher): €50,000/year
Scrubber-driers (TASKI): €25,000/year
Vacuums (PanGoslar): €15,000/year
Administrative overhead: €10,000/year (managing 3 vendors)
TOTAL: €100,000
```

**Consolidated with Kärcher:**
```
All equipment (Kärcher): €90,000/year
- 10% volume discount: -€10,000
Single vendor management: Easier
TOTAL: €90,000 (saves €10,000 + simplicity)
```

**Your pitch:** "One vendor. One relationship. One support line. Same quality for less money."

### Success Metric
**Q1 Goal:** €30-40k (new equipment categories)

---

## COMPANY #5: EES Sistemi - Product Gap Problem

### Situation
- **Current Kärcher:** Backpack vacuums ONLY
- **Gap:** HUGE - missing scrubber-driers, robots, etc
- **Competitor:** TASKI, Ruby, Klintek (taking the big budget)
- **Budget:** €100k/year
- **Contact:** Lidija Kobal, Operations Manager
- **Key Insight:** Only using backpack vacs. Competitors winning everything else.

### Your Opportunity

**You're in the door with backpack vacs. Expand to bigger machines.**

Why backpack vacs only? Usually because:
- That's what they asked for originally
- They don't know you offer more
- Competitor already has relationship on big stuff

### Your Action Plan

#### This Week: Discovery Call
**CALL Lidija:**
```
"Hi Lidija, the backpack vacuums are working well?
Good! I want to understand - 
do you use any other Kärcher equipment?
What about scrubber-driers? Pressure washers?
I ask because most companies your size benefit from 
a full Kärcher solution.
Have you considered upgrading?"
```

#### Week 2: Needs Assessment
- What type of floors do they clean most? (hard? carpet?)
- Do they have outdoor areas? (parking, entrances?)
- Any large floor areas? (atriums, warehouses?)
- Current satisfaction with TASKI/others?

#### Week 3: Demo of Missing Equipment
- Bring demo machine for their biggest gap
- Show vs current setup
- Show efficiency gains
- ROI calculation

#### Week 4: Proposal + Close

### Financial Case

**What they probably need:**
- Replace backpack vacs with better solution
- Add scrubber-drier (for hard floors)
- Add pressure washer (for outdoor)

**Total investment:** €40-60k
**Annual savings vs current:** €8-12k (efficiency gains)
**Payback:** 4-6 years

### Success Metric
**Q1 Goal:** €20-30k (expand from backpack-only)

---

## COMPANY #6: B+N Facilities - Upsell Opportunity

### Situation
- **Current Kärcher:** Wide range (sweepers, small scrubber-driers, vacuums) ✅ GOOD!
- **Issue:** Unknown competitors (maybe small amounts)
- **Budget:** €100k/year
- **Contact:** Urša, Purchasing Manager
- **Key Insight:** Already buying well from us. UPSELL opportunity.

### Your Opportunity

### Your Action Plan

#### This Week: Review Call
**CALL Urša:**
```
"Hi Urša, how's the equipment performing across all your facilities?
Great! I want to make sure we're serving you well.
Are there any pain points or needs we're not addressing?
Anything you'd like to see improved or added?"
```

#### Week 2: Quarterly Business Review
- How is current equipment performing?
- Any breakdowns or issues?
- Are they growing (new facilities)?
- What's next for them?
- Can we expand?

#### Week 3: Expansion Proposal
If they're growing, propose:
- More machines for new facilities
- Newer/better models than what they have
