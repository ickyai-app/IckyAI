# Kärcher B2B Sales Playbook - BSC Focus

## Your Role: Key Account Manager for Kärcher Professional Cleaning Equipment

**Target:** Large Business Service Companies (BSC) + Facilities Management operators
**Goal:** Increase revenue by building long-term relationships with high-volume customers
**Timeline:** 6-12 month sales cycles typically

---

## Part 1: Understanding Your Customer (BSC Companies)

### Who Are They?
Business Service Companies (BSC) / Facilities Management operators are companies that:
- Manage cleaning for 10-1000+ buildings
- Need industrial-grade equipment
- Buy in volume (multiple machines, ongoing contracts)
- Have tight budgets but understand ROI
- Make decisions based on cost-per-square-meter or cost-per-hour

### What They Care About
1. **Efficiency** - How much area can one operator clean per day?
2. **Cost per clean** - What's the total cost to clean a 1000m² building?
3. **Reliability** - Will it break down and cost them contracts?
4. **Training** - Can their staff learn to use it quickly?
5. **Support** - Can you help when there's a problem?
6. **Sustainability** - Are they eco-conscious? Water/chemical usage?

### Their Challenges
- Tight profit margins (2-8% typically)
- Staff turnover (high training costs)
- Equipment breakdowns lose them contracts
- Competition from other BSCs drives prices down
- Labor costs rising (need productivity gains)

**Your advantage:** Kärcher machines SAVE them money through efficiency.

## Part 2: How to Approach a BSC Company

### The Decision Makers (Know These Roles)

1. **Operations Manager** (Your main contact)
   - Uses equipment daily or oversees users
   - Cares about: reliability, ease of use, maintenance
   - Influencer, not final approver

2. **Procurement Manager**
   - Controls budget and vendor relationships
   - Cares about: price, payment terms, service support
   - Can kill deals on price

3. **Finance Director / CFO**
   - Approves large purchases
   - Cares about: ROI, total cost of ownership, cash flow
   - Makes final yes/no

4. **Business Owner / CEO**
   - For smaller BSCs (<50 employees)
   - Makes decisions directly
   - Cares about: profitability, growth, risk

### The Multi-Step Approach

#### Step 1: Research (Before You Call)
- Find their top 5 clients (facility types they clean)
- Identify their fleet size (how many people, trucks)
- Understand their service areas
- Check their website for "news" (expansion = growth = money)
- Find them on LinkedIn

#### Step 2: The First Call (Get the Meeting)
**Script:**
```
"Hi [NAME], this is [YOU] from Kärcher.
We work with BSC companies to reduce their cleaning time by 30-40%.
I noticed you're managing facilities in [AREA].
Could I share some ideas specific to your customers? 15 minutes this week?"
```

**Why this works:**
- Specific benefit (30-40% time reduction)
- Relevant to them (their service areas)
- Low commitment (15 min)
- Opens door (ideas, not a sales pitch)

**If they say no:** "Can I send you a quick comparison of cleaning costs? No strings attached."

#### Step 3: The First Meeting (Qualify Them)
**What to bring:**
- One-pager with Kärcher's top 3 machines (not a catalog)
- ROI calculator for their business
- 2-3 case studies from similar BSCs
- Your phone to take notes

**What to ask:**
1. "What types of facilities do you clean most?"
2. "What's your current cleaning equipment?"
3. "What's the biggest pain point with your setup?" (Listen 80%)
4. "If you could clean faster with the same quality, what would that be worth?"
5. "How do you make equipment decisions?"

**Red flags (Walk away if...):**
- They only care about price
- Decision process involves 5+ people
- No budget allocated
- Equipment is "fine" (no urgency)

**Green lights (Move forward if...):**
- They recognize equipment pain points
- They ask about ROI
- They want to see the machines work
- Operations Manager excited + Finance supports

#### Step 4: The Demo / Proof of Concept
**Best approach:** On-site demo at one of their facilities

**What to do:**
1. Arrange with their Operations Manager
2. Bring 2 people (you + technician)
3. Demo one problem area (usually a hard-to-clean floor type)
4. Compare to their current method (time/quality)
5. Get Operations Manager feedback
6. Get a "before" time measurement

**The conversation after demo:**
- "How did this compare?"
- "What would this do for your efficiency?"
- "Could you scale this to your other facilities?"
- "What's your next step?"

#### Step 5: The Proposal (Not Yet!)
**First, get informal agreement:**
- "If the numbers worked, would you move forward?"
- "What budget are we talking about?"
- "When would you implement?"

**Then send 1-page proposal:**
```

#### Step 6: Close It
**When they're ready:**
"Great. I'll draw up the contract for [AMOUNT] with delivery [DATE]. Sound good?"

**If they hesitate:**
"What's the blockers?"
- No budget: "Can we move this to Q2?"

## Part 3: Selling Kärcher to BSCs

- Rented spaces look "new" (keeps tenants)

**The pitch:**
"You can now bid on cleaning contracts you couldn't do profitably before. New revenue."

**Typical BSC gain:** €1000-3000/month in new bids won

#### 3. Vacuum Cleaner (nt / NT series)
**Best for:** Indoor carpets, hard floors
**Sells to:** Offices, schools, healthcare

**Why BSCs love it:**
- Handles wet + dry (spills, construction sites)
- Portable (fits in truck)
- 3x more efficient than traditional vacuums

## Part 6: Objection Handling

### "Your machines are too expensive"
Response: "I get that. But let's look at cost-per-square-meter cleaned. Our machine does [AREA] in [TIME] at [COST]. Your current method does [AREA] in [TIME] at [COST]. The Kärcher actually costs less. Here's the math..."

### "We're happy with our current supplier"
Response: "I totally understand. I'm not asking you to switch everything. What if we did a small test with one machine in one facility? Prove it works. If it does, great. If not, no commitment."

### "We don't have budget"
Response: "When would budget open up? Q2? Q3? Let's put this on your calendar for then. I'll send you the ROI so you can plan for it."

### "We need to think about it"
Response: "Of course. What specifically do you want to think about? The price? The logistics? The effectiveness? Let's address that now so you have what you need."

### "We'll call you if we're interested"
Response: "I appreciate that. Since your business is changing [mention something you learned], I'll check in with you in 2 weeks with some updated info. Sound good?"
