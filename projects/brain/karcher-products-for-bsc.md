## Machine #1: Scrubber-Dryer (Floor Cleaning)

### Models for BSC
- **iCLASS** (€15-20K) - Best for daily use

### The BSC Value Proposition

#### Time Savings
```
OLD METHOD (Manual + mop):
- 1 operator cleaning 500m² = 3-4 hours
- Same 500m² with Kärcher = 45 minutes
- Time saved: 2-3 hours per day per person
- Per month: 40-60 hours saved

COST IMPACT:
- If labor = €15/hour
- Savings = €600-900/month per person
- Per machine per year = €7,200-10,800
```

#### The Pitch
> "Your team spends X hours/week on floor cleaning. With Kärcher, you cut it by 50-60%. At your labor costs, that's €[Y] saved every month. Plus, floors look better - tenants are happier - less complaints."

### The BSC Value Proposition

#### Win New Contracts
```
SCENARIO:
A local mall wants their parking lot cleaned quarterly.
Budget: €3,000/cleaning
They ask you to bid.

OLD SCENARIO:
- You need 4 people × 2 days each = 8 labor days
- Cost: 8 × €200 = €1,600 labor cost
- You barely break even (€3,000 - €1,600 - supplies = €400 profit)
- You don't bid (too low margin)

NEW SCENARIO (with Kärcher):
- You need 2 people × 1 day = 2 labor days
- Cost: 2 × €200 = €400 labor cost
- You make solid profit (€3,000 - €400 - supplies = €2,100 profit)
- You WIN the bid and gain a recurring client
```

#### The Pitch
> "Right now, you can't bid profitably on outdoor cleaning. With Kärcher, you can suddenly take on contracts you've been passing up. That's new revenue. How many projects like this do you see annually?"

### Financial Argument for Pressure Washer

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| **INVESTMENT** |
| Machine | €10,000 |
| Training | €500 |
| Hoses + attachments | €1,000 |
| **Total Cost** | **€11,500** |
| | |

| Premium pricing (professional finish) | €2,000 |
| **Total Additional Revenue** | **€14,000** |
| | |
| **PROFIT (Year 1)** | **€2,500** |
| **PROFIT (Year 5)** | **€60,000+** |

## Machine #3: Industrial Vacuum Cleaner (Carpet/Floors)

### Models for BSC
- **nt 35/1 Tact** (€3-5K) - Small, portable

### Perfect For:
- Offices (carpet areas)
- Hotels (carpets + spills)
- Hospitals (hygiene critical)
- Schools/Universities
- Factories (debris, dust)
- Large retail (daily cleaning)

### The BSC Value Proposition

#### Reliability
```
PROBLEM:
You use cheap vacuum cleaners.
Every 18-24 months, they break.
Cost: €2K per replacement × 3-4 vacuums = €6-8K every 2 years

SOLUTION:
One Kärcher vacuum lasts 7-10 years.
Upfront cost: €10K
Total 10-year cost: €10K (vs €30-40K with cheap ones)
SAVES: €20-30K over decade
```

#### The Pitch
> "You're replacing vacuums every 2 years. With Kärcher, you buy once and it works for 10 years. Less downtime, less maintenance hassle, less total cost."

### Financial Argument for Vacuum

| Item | Cheap Vacuum | Kärcher |
|---|---|---|
| **COST** |
| Purchase price | €2,000 | €10,000 |
| Lifespan | 2 years | 10 years |
| Replacement cost (5 times) | €10,000 | €0 |
| Maintenance/repairs | €1,500 | €500 |
| Downtime cost | €2,000 | €500 |
| **10-YEAR TOTAL** | **€15,500** | **€11,000** |

## Selling Strategy by Situation

### Situation 1: "We're happy with our supplier"

**Response:**
"I totally understand. [Supplier] is fine. I'm not asking you to switch everything. Here's what I propose: let me do a small test in one of your facilities. One area, one day. No obligation. We'll clean it with Kärcher, you compare. If it's better, great. If not, no hard feelings."

**Why it works:** Removes risk. They can see it without committing.

---

### Situation 2: "Your machines are expensive"

**Response:**
"I hear you - upfront, yes. But let's talk total cost of ownership. Here's your typical cost with your current method [SHOW MATH]. Here's the Kärcher cost over 5 years [SHOW MATH]. Kärcher is actually cheaper. Plus, your team is more productive, so you can take on new contracts."

**Why it works:** Shows the real ROI, not just sticker price.

---

### Situation 3: "We're cutting budget this year"

**Response:**
"I get it - tough times. What if the machine PAYS FOR ITSELF? It saves you [€X] in labor costs per month. In 8-10 months, you've recovered the investment, then pure profit after that. Would that make sense for your budget?"

**Why it works:** Frames it as an investment, not an expense.

---

### Situation 4: "We lease our equipment"

**Response:**
"Perfect. We can lease Kärcher machines too. €[X]/month includes delivery, training, maintenance. Way simpler than managing it yourself. Want to see the lease terms?"

**Why it works:** Solves the cash flow concern. Offers flexibility.

---

## Quick Closing Statements

### If they're interested:
> "Great. So let's put this in motion. I'll prep the contract for [MACHINE] with delivery on [DATE]. We do training on [DATE]. You'll see the time savings within week one. Sound good?"

### If they're hesitating:
> "What's the one thing that would make you comfortable moving forward? Is it price? Timeline? Wanting to see it work first?"

### If they want to think about it:
> "Of course. What specifically would help you decide? The ROI math? A demo? Let's make sure you have what you need."

## Competitive Comparison

**Kärcher vs Alternatives:**

| Feature | Kärcher | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|---|---|---|---|
| Upfront cost | €18K | €15K | €20K |
| Durability | 10 years | 5 years | 7 years |
| Support | 24/7 | Business hours | Email only |
| Training | Included | Extra fee | DIY |
| **5-Year Cost** | **€20K** | **€27K** | **€25K** |

**Your message:** "Yes, others are cheaper upfront. But Kärcher lasts longer, we provide better support, and total cost is actually less."

---

## Your Elevator Pitch

### 30 seconds:
"We help BSC companies clean more efficiently. Our Kärcher equipment cuts cleaning time by 50%, which means your team can either clean more in the same time, or do the same cleaning with fewer people. Either way, you save money or win new contracts. That's why [COMPANY] switched to us."

### 2 minutes:
"Most cleaning companies are stuck with old, slow equipment. Kärcher changes that. For example, if you're cleaning a 5,000 m² office building with a mop and bucket, it takes 8-10 hours. With our scrubber-dryer, 2-3 hours. Same quality, way faster. Over a month, that's days of labor you're saving. For a company with 10 employees, that's like hiring one more person without the salary. Our customers save €10-15K per year per machine. That's real money."
