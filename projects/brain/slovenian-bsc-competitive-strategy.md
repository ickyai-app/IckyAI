## Your Win-Back Strategy

### Phase 1: Audit (This Week)
- [ ] List all machines each company currently owns/uses
- [ ] List all machines they buy from competitors
- [ ] Identify the reason for each competitor purchase
- [ ] Find out their annual cleaning equipment budget
- [ ] Identify decision makers + influencers

### Phase 2: Opportunity Analysis
**For each company, create:**
```
COMPANY: [Name]

CURRENT KÄRCHER:
- Machine 1: [Model], [Usage], [Budget]
- Machine 2: [Model], [Usage], [Budget]

COMPETITOR MACHINES:
- [Competitor 1]: [Model], [Why they bought], [Budget]
- [Competitor 2]: [Model], [Why they bought], [Budget]

OPPORTUNITY:
- [Machine/Service we're missing]
- [Why it matters to them]
- [ROI/benefit]
- [Estimated budget to win]

STRATEGY:
- Primary approach: [What we'll do]
- Timeline: [When]
- Expected outcome: [What we'll win]
```

### Phase 3: The Win-Back Pitch

#### If it's PRICE:
**Meeting with Finance Director:**
> "I know you buy [Competitor] equipment. I respect that - they're good. But let's compare total cost. Our machine costs €[X], lasts 10 years, saves €[Y]/month in labor. Theirs costs €[Z], lasts 6 years. Over 10 years, we're actually cheaper. Plus, volume discount brings it down to €[Lower]. Want to see the math?"

#### If it's PRODUCT GAP:
**Meeting with Operations Manager:**
> "I noticed you buy [Competitor's machine] for [specific job]. We have Kärcher's [Our machine] that's designed for exactly this. Let me bring one in, show you side-by-side with what you're using now. No obligation."

#### If it's SERVICE/RELATIONSHIP:
**Direct conversation:**
> "I know you've worked with [Competitor] for years. That's fine. I want to earn your business too. Here's what I'm committing to: 24-hour response time, monthly check-ins, inventory of your top 3 parts locally, dedicated support line. Let's do a small pilot."

#### If it's HISTORICAL MOMENTUM:
**The soft approach:**
> "You've got a good setup with [Competitor]. I'm not asking you to switch everything. What if we did a small test? One new machine from Kärcher for [specific job], one facility. Prove it works. If it doesn't, no harm. If it does, we expand. Fair?"

If Kärcher wins, expand with us. If [Competitor] wins, I'll respect that. But let's test."
