## Finding Decision Makers

### LinkedIn Search Strategy
1. Search: "[Company name] facilities manager"
2. Filter: 1st degree, 2nd degree
3. Look for: Director, Manager, Owner titles
4. Check: Updates/activity (active = more likely to respond)
5. Connect: "Hi [Name], I help BSC companies increase cleaning efficiency with Kärcher equipment..."

### Phone Research Strategy
1. Call main number: "Hi, I'm looking for the person managing facilities operations?"
2. Ask: "Who's responsible for cleaning equipment?"
3. Get transferred: "Great, what's their name?"
4. Call them directly: "Hi [Name], [Assistant] suggested I call you..."

### Email Research
- LinkedIn: Many have visible email or "Open to offers"
- Hunter.io: Find email patterns
- Company website: Contact page often lists management
- Glassdoor: Employee reviews often mention manager names

---

## Follow-Up Sequence

### If They Don't Call Back:

**Day 3:** Email with case study
**Day 7:** Call again ("Just following up...")
**Day 14:** Email with different angle (maybe they clean a specific facility type - show that case study)
**Day 21:** Call with "I'm in your area next week"
**Day 30:** Final email: "Just removing you from my list - if things change..." (reverse psychology)

### If They Say "Call Back Later":
- Ask: "When's good? [Date/Time]?"
- Calendar it
- Call exactly on time
- They'll respect it

---

## Red Flags (Skip These Companies)

- ❌ "We're fine with our current supplier" + no interest = move on
- ❌ Owner/decision maker unavailable + bureaucratic process = long shot
- ❌ No budget + "maybe next year" = not ready
- ❌ Only care about cheapest price, no mention of efficiency = wrong fit

---

## Green Lights (Prioritize These)

- ✅ They ask questions about ROI = they think
- ✅ They want a demo = they're serious
- ✅ Operations manager + Finance both interested = approval pathway clear
- ✅ "What's the timeline?" = they're moving forward
- ✅ They mention expansion plans = growth = money
